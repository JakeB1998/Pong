# Pong

This pong game made in pure Java using the JavaFX front end framework. This is a two human player game with AI to be added at a later date. I am still in the proccess of conducting code cleanup and to update the project with more advanced programming techniques and concepts.

## Controls

Controls are lower case.

### Player 1
- Move paddle up: W
- Move paddle down: S

### Player 2
- Move paddle up: P
- Move paddle down: L

Source code is set up with api level systems like key binding that I will eventually extract to either a game libriry or the Aveono Utility library in a game subpackage. This makes it easy to alter if you would like to change the controls or many other systems.
